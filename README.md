# Project Schrödinger

A cryptographically "collapsed" system where AI agents are encrypted in a state of quantum uncertainty, rendering them unhackable and unbackdoorable by design.

## Overview

Project Schrödinger uses **quantitative cryptography** (measurable entropy thresholds, statistical proof-of-sanctity) and **topological obfuscation** to create AI systems that exist in three simultaneous encrypted states, collapsing to plaintext only under strict quantum-measured conditions.

## Core Architecture: The Three-Body Encryption Problem

### Layers

1. **Homomorphic Lattice Shell**
   - Encrypts the AI model weights/data using **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (quantum-safe)
   - Allows computations on encrypted data via **Microsoft SEAL** (homomorphic encryption)
   - *Quantitative Hook*: Entropy threshold of ≥7.9 bits/byte enforced; auto-shred if entropy drops

2. **Topological Proof Network**
   - Wraps the AI in a **BLS-12-381 elliptic curve** "proof mesh" where each node must cryptographically prove it's unmodified
   - Uses **zk-SNARKs** to verify computations without revealing the model

3. **Quantum-Secure Timelock**
   - Decryption keys are sharded via **Shamir's Secret Sharing** and time-released using **Silurian LCS35 puzzles** (takes 35+ years to crack classically)

## Anti-Deepfake Protocol: Adversarial Entropy Sinks

Floods shadow AI with cryptographically engineered "garbage data" that mimics real patterns but contains trapdoor statistical flaws.

## Key Management: Non-Euclidean Blockchain

Keys are stored in a **4D simplicial complex** (math structure) across decentralized nodes. Requires solving **NP-hard** problems to reconstruct.

- **Key Shard Locations** = Solutions to the **Traveling Salesman Problem** on a dynamic graph
- **Consensus Protocol**: Proof-of-Topology (nodes must map to a valid Klein bottle configuration)

## Quantitative Attack Surface Metrics

| Threat Vector          | Defense Mechanism                 | Entropy Threshold |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Brute Force            | Kyber-1024 + Timelock             | 2^256 complexity  |
| Model Extraction       | zk-SNARKed Homomorphic Layer      | ∞ (zero-knowledge)|
| Deepfake Poisoning     | Adversarial Entropy Sinks         | 99.9% noise ratio|
| Backdoor Insertion     | Formal Verification (Coq proofs)  | 100% proof coverage|

## Deployment Strategy

1. **AI Framework Plugins**: Build for PyTorch/TensorFlow that auto-encrypts models during `model.save()`
2. **Decentralized Consensus Cloud**: Partner with Filecoin/IPFS for shard storage
3. **Quantum Audit Trail**: Use IBM Quantum to generate verifiable randomness seeds

## Thermodynamic Enforcement

Embed **NIST SP 800-90B** entropy sources (hardware RNGs) that trigger **cryptographic apoptosis** (self-destruct) if:
- Entropy drops below 7.2 bits/byte
- Key shards show Borel regularity (indicates mathematical backdoors)
- Ambient temperature fluctuates (anti-physical tampering)
