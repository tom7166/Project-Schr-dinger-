# Project Schrödinger

A cryptographically "collapsed" system where AI agents are encrypted in a state of quantum uncertainty, rendering them unhackable and unbackdoorable by design.

## Overview

Project Schrödinger uses **quantitative cryptography** (measurable entropy thresholds, statistical proof-of-sanctity) and **topological obfuscation** to create AI systems that exist in three simultaneous encrypted states, collapsing to plaintext only under strict quantum-measured conditions.

## Core Architecture: The Three-Body Encryption Problem

### Layers

1. **Homomorphic Lattice Shell**
   - Encrypts the AI model weights/data using **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (quantum-safe)
   - Allows computations on encrypted data via **Microsoft SEAL** (homomorphic encryption)
   - *Quantitative Hook*: Entropy threshold of ≥7.9 bits/byte enforced; auto-shred if entropy drops

2. **Topological Proof Network**
   - Wraps the AI in a **BLS-12-381 elliptic curve** "proof mesh" where each node must cryptographically prove it's unmodified
   - Uses **zk-SNARKs** to verify computations without revealing the model

3. **Quantum-Secure Timelock**
   - Decryption keys are sharded via **Shamir's Secret Sharing** and time-released using **Silurian LCS35 puzzles** (takes 35+ years to crack classically)
