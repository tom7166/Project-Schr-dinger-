# Project Schrödinger
A cryptographically "collapsed" system where AI agents are encrypted in a state of quantum uncertainty, rendering them unhackable and unbackdoorable by design.

## Overview
Project Schrödinger uses **quantitative cryptography** (measurable entropy thresholds, statistical proof-of-sanctity) and **topological obfuscation** to create AI systems that exist in three simultaneous encrypted states, collapsing to plaintext only under strict quantum-measured conditions.

## Core Architecture: The Three-Body Encryption Problem
### Layers
1. **Homomorphic Lattice Shell**
   - Encrypts the AI model weights/data using **CRYSTALS-Kyber** (quantum-safe)
   - Allows computations on encrypted data via **Microsoft SEAL** (homomorphic encryption)
   - *Quantitative Hook*: Entropy threshold of ≥7.9 bits/byte enforced; auto-shred if entropy drops
2. **Topological Proof Network**
   - Wraps the AI in a **BLS-12-381 elliptic curve** "proof mesh" where each node must cryptographically prove it's unmodified
   - Uses **zk-SNARKs** to verify computations without revealing the model
3. **Quantum-Secure Timelock**
   - Decryption keys are sharded via **Shamir's Secret Sharing** and time-released using **Silurian LCS35 puzzles** (takes 35+ years to crack classically)

## Anti-Deepfake Protocol: Adversarial Entropy Sinks
Floods shadow AI with cryptographically engineered "garbage data" that appears valid but contains subtle proof-of-work puzzles that cause replicas to behave erratically.

## Thermodynamic Enforcement
Embeds NIST SP 800-90B entropy sources (hardware RNGs) that trigger cryptographic apoptosis (self-destruct) if:
- Entropy drops below 7.2 bits/byte
- Key shards show Borel regularity (indicates mathematical backdoors)
- Ambient temperature fluctuates (anti-physical tampering)
